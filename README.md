# Magic 8 Ball API

I built this API inspired by [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-rest-api-typescript-using-native-modules/) to replace the [kanye.rest](https://kanye.rest/) API we usually use to first introduce bootcampers to using `fetch` at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.com/). We used kanye.rest because of its ease of use and simplicity of response structure, but for obvious reasons, thanks to his actions, it unfortunately doesn't seem like a good idea to use from now on!

I wanted to go back to basics and combine TypeScript with the bare-bones HTTP module as I'm used to using Express with all its bells and whistles.

TODO:

- Deploy API
- Create landing page with example, similar to kanye.rest's landing page
